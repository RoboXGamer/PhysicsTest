# Faraday Generator Physics Simulation

This project simulates a Faraday generator using Three.js for 3D visualization. The simulation demonstrates electromagnetic induction through a rotating magnetic wheel and copper coil setup.

## Components and Structure

### Physical Structure
1. Base Plate
   - Horizontal flat plate serving as the foundation
   - Supports all other components

2. Copper Coil
   - Spherical coil design
   - Mounted horizontally on the base plate
   - Connected to LED indicators via copper wires

3. Support Structure
   - Mounted on sides of the coil
   - Contains bearings for wheel rotation
   - Provides stable support for the rotating wheel

4. Magnetic Wheel
   - Mounted above the coil
   - Contains alternating magnets (N-S poles)
   - Rotates to induce current in the coil

5. LED Indicators
   - Two LED lights connected to the coil
   - Brightness varies with induced current
   - Demonstrates AC current generation

### Visualization Features
- Realistic copper coil with spherical winding
- Magnetic field visualization using particles
- Real-time EMF, current, and power readings
- Interactive controls for:
  - Rotation speed (RPM)
  - Magnet strength (Tesla)
  - Number of coil turns

## Technical Implementation
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Physics-based calculations for electromagnetic induction
- Real-time updates of electrical parameters
- Particle system for magnetic field visualization
